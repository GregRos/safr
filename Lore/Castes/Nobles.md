During the [[Classical Era]] being a noble meant having power that you could use as you saw fit. In those days, the only reliable way to defend your kingdom from monsters was to take a few young men who don’t know any better, give them weapons they could barely use, and gesture vaguely at the uncaring wilderness. 

As society changedand heroes grew in prominence, the nobility lost its power and most of their privileges. They might still administer the lands that had been in their family for thousands of years, but they only do so at the behest of the guilds.

# Titled Bureaucrats
![[CycleSociety.png|right|300]]Nobles are essentially the heads of bureaucracies that consist of small armies of officials, some of whom may be their family members. These form the noble household which manages some of guild’s land on its behalf.

And yet they still play the part of a noble of old, complete with all the trappings. They have servants, opulent mansions, titles, and perhaps even a handful of guards. Family members vie with each other for prestige, seeking the guild’s favor, and may yearn to overthrow the current head of their house. 

As part of their job, nobles levee obligations on commoners and merchants. These obligations consist of paying taxes, obeying laws, reporting agricultural yields, and so forth. They also hear the petitions of the common folk, handle small matters of justice, arrest common lawbreakers, and report any seditious activity to the guild.

This creates a social cycle in which heroes are seen as guardians and protectors, while nobles are seen as greedy overlords who merely take from their subjects. The occasional noble rebellion against guild authority helps cement this pantomime and helps the guild maintain the facade.

# The Bitter
While commoners usually believe the show, the cycle of society is something any well-educated child understands. Nobles understand it most of all, since they’re the ones stuck feeling the yoke.

It’s no surprise that this makes some of their number quite bitter. Disgruntled nobles can attempt to weave plots, embezzle gold, or even court foreign guilds. However, they must be careful not to attract the attention of their guild, since they can easily be replaced by another member of their house.

In those days heroes were too few in number to have much pull in the world, and the only reliable way to defend your kingdom from monsters was to take a few young men who don’t know any better, give them weapons they could barely use, and gesture vaguely at the uncaring wilderness. 



However, as [[The Twilight Stand|heroes grew in personal power]], there came a tipping point after which the political landscape began to shift. Heroes began to enforce their will on society through the instrument of [[Guild]], culminating in the [[The Forging|Forging of the Chain]], which laid the first stones of the [[Great Guild]].

As this was happening, the role of nobles in society began to shift. 

Today, [[The Twilight Stand|The Stand]] is celebrated throughout the guild lands in various different ways, as its si
