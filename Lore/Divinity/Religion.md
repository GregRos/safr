So, you asked me for a lore dump, primarily focused on gods and the like. Well, the setting doesn’t have a single pantheon or a single list of agreed upon gods. I call my approach *all the gods!*

I was thinking that people believe in different gods that are mutually exclusive. Some people are monotheistic. Others believe in one pantheon, still others another. Everyone gets spells from their belief if it’s strong enough, but they all believe in contradictory things.

A third party observer who doesn’t believe in any gods can’t understand what the reality is. Are there different gods, or one god, or several groups? People can be very certain of their belief and get specific spells which are like exactly what they believe in, but all beliefs can’t be true if looked at logically.

For this to work, gods can’t have a will of their own or an ability to affect the world not through people, as otherwise they can just say “Hey, I exist!”, and instead they’re kind of silent. If they exist, they only work through people.
