The [[Great Guild]] is simply all the numerous [[Guild|guilds]], viewed as a single entity. When viewed in this way, this alliance stretches over vast territories and covers almost the entirety of the known world.

Almost all cities, factions, or groups are largely defined by their relationship with the Great Guild. Those few that don’t are special cases that might have different relationships with different members.

Everyone knows about the Great Guild and refers to it as a concept. Most see it as permanent and immutable – it has, after all, existed for thousands of years – and many swear allegiance to it.  However, there are also good reasons to claim the Great Guild doesn’t exist. 

* The Great Guild has no infrastructure of its own
* It claims no territories
* It has no leader or ruling council, even a ceremonial one
* It has no bureaucracy
* It doesn’t even have a list of members

Essentially, any entity recognized as a [[guild]] is also necessarily part of the Great Guild. This means that the same 

Because of this, to say that a statement applies to the Great Guild is the same as saying it’s true of all guilds. 

The question of being part of the Great Guild is never an absolute one — different guilds might not recognize each other, while a third guild recognizes both or neither. In practice, it comes down to two things:

1. Being recognized as a [[guild]].
2. 

In practice, however, the matter comes down to the capacity for [[Guild War]], which is ironic since it breaks the only principles that matter to it.



It doesn’t even have a list of members, nor any official process of recognizing them. The question of membership can only be decided

The Great Guild can only be said to adopt a particular policy, purpose, regulation, or goal if all of its members share it. This also means that anyone can claim to be part of the Great Guild, or apart from it, sinc

Any policies the Great Guild can be said to adopt, including [[The Principles|the shared principles that guide it]], 




. Many of its member [[Guild|guilds]] are ideologically opposed to one another. Some of them even [[guild war|go to war]]. 

, and [[The Principles]] only affect [[Heroes]] and not anyone else. 


* The Great Guild has no infrastructure of its own, 
* no way of compelling the obedience of its members,
* no leader, not even a ceremonial one,
* no 
* no bureaucracy to implement them.

Instead, it manifests as guilds and heroes working towards their own self-interests, while following a small set of shared principles, under the limits imposed by other guilds and heroes doing the same.

This abstract framework is the only thing that allows guilds to peacefully coexist, in light of their many different traditions and ideologies. Before [[The Forging]], [[Guild War]] was a fact of life, rather than a specter to be avoided at all costs.

# The Principles
To [[Heroes]], the shared principles might be the most important thing about the Great Guild, since they impose limits on what guilds can do to non-member heroes, as well as what heroes can do to each other. While some guilds might differ in their interpretation of specific principles, none deny their validity.

The Principles aren’t quite frozen, but they evolve at a glacial pace. Since the
