In a world long removed from the era of nations and kingdoms, guilds have become the dominant force in society and politics. These guilds, evolving beyond traditional professional associations, replaced ancient governmental structures long ago. This shift has profoundly reshaped societal dynamics, establishing guilds as the primary form of governance.

Guilds, initially formed as networks of [[Heroes]], have evolved from informal alliances into powerful, sovereign entities. Originating from heroes' needs for collaboration and support, these guilds have grown into influential collectives, commanding extensive territories.

Guilds, varying significantly in size, ideology, and structure, range from small bands to massive organizations with thousands of members. Regardless of their size, each guild is defined by its heroic members, who are essential for enforcing the guild's will, serving effectively as its army and militia.

Being sovereign powers, guilds are bound not by laws, but by alliances, obligations, and the politics of power. They coexist peacefully only through adherence to [[The Principles]], which provide a basic framework that governs guild and hero relations.

A guild’s sovereignty rests on its ability to defend its interests and territories, and thus on its capacity to wage [[Guild War]]. While guild war is no longer common, the ability to wage it is a primary concern for every guild.

# Guild Lands
The guilds together divide most of the known world into *guild lands*, territories under their protection. Since they have a monopoly on protection in these lands, they also have a monopoly on force, meaning they can do in these lands as they see fit.

Guilds seldom manage their territories directly, delegating day-to-day governance to [[nobles]] and local leaders. These traditional leaders operate under the guilds' overarching influence, fully aware of their subordinate role.

Guild lands usually consist of multiple settlements, such as villages, towns, cities, and so forth. These settlements have their own law enforcement groups, like a city watch. However, the purpose of these groups is to discourage and punish lawbreaking by commoners. They will report any serious incidents, such as monster attacks, to the guild.

Guilds don’t rely on these groups for information, and will frequently maintain their own networks of informants within the community. These are usually ordinary people, such as bakers, farmers, artisans, or merchants. They also act as part-time spies for the guild, reporting on events that might destabilize the region, and serve as an additional check on the nobility.

# Guild Members
All guilds have members – these are the [[heroes]] that belong to that guild. While guilds can employ non-heroes, such as [[Peasants]], [[Artisans]], [[Nobles]], and so forth, only heroes will ever be called upon to enforce the will of their guild through force.

This means that heroes serve as a guild’s army and militia, and that the strength of a guild is directly proportional to the strength and number of its heroic members. The largest guilds boast thousands of members, and the largest [[Alliance|alliances]] might call upon a hundred thousand or more.

However, many guilds might only have a handful of members, and a few have only one – in that case, such a hero would literally be a one-man army.

## The trouble with heroes
Heroes are not mindless servants of their guilds. The relationship between a guild and its members is complex and multi-faceted, which places practical limits on what a guild can do.

While a guild is usually much greater than a single hero, each hero is also precious to its guild and potentially irreplaceable. At the same time, a disillusioned hero can find it fairly easy to join a different guild.



These ties go both ways. While a veteran hero might be able to switch guilds in principle, most do not.

Heroes always have minds of their own, along with moral compasses that can point in all kinds of directions. They are free-thinking individuals who might value other things above their guild, and might disagree with its actions.

Guilds are never the subjects of anyone or anything, though they must conform to [[The Principles]] to be recognized as a guild at all.

All guilds, taken as a single entity, form the [[Great Guild]], which is more an abstract concept than an actual polity.

There is no official list of guilds. Whether an entity or group is a guild

A guild only exists as far as it can defend its possessions – territories, artifacts, secrets, and so on – with the threat of [[Guild War]].  

While there are many qualities guilds can be said to possess, they all have exceptions — except on. A guild exists only in so far as it 

# Qualities of Guilds
Guilds always have **members**, who tend to be individuals of significant personal power. 


At its core, a guild is a group of heroes who share a common vision, goal, purpose, or dream. A motive.

Guild are sovereign. They are bound by alliances and obligations, not laws. All guilds are part of the [[Great Guild]], but that is a framework that governs relations between guilds rather than a body that tells guilds what to do.

No law or procedure can ban a guild.

These motives can range from accumulating as much wealth as possible to dismantling the guild system from within.
