In the past, during the [[Classical Era]], wars were fought by giant groups of men waving sharp bits on metal around on sticks. Armies, in those days, were slow and ponderous to move, and it was obvious when they did so. 

The warriors, terrified and poorly trained, would frequently run away the second the tides of battle turned.

Another rather quaint thing was the concept of a *commander*. This was a man who had – unlike all other combatants – studied fighting, and thus knew what to do. He would make up a strategy and all the other men would be forced to follow it on pain of death.

In Guild War, most of those things simply do not apply. In fact, let’s investigate the sillines;.l////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////, s of that concept using a comparison.

| Factor                 | Classical                          | Heroic                            |

| **Dexterity**          | Takes hours to start marching      | Can stop or move whenever         |
| **Mobility**           | Very slow to move                  | Can move extremely quickly        |

Half of a guild war is fought plainly, in battles that usually take place over settlements. They aim of the battle is rarely to destroy the settlement; it’s always a battle of attrition. Nevertheless, settlements that are fought over are likely to be destroyed as collateral damage. 

The battle might continue beyond that point for other reasons.

Individual battles, when they do happen, can last for days, but not more than that. The thing being fought over will usually be destroyed before too much time elapses.

Retreat from battle is rare, but escape from the war is more common. This is usually done by trying to join another guild. However, as all guilds are afraid of guild war, taking someone in because they refuse to fight in one can be counter-productive.



Classical soldiers would run away, but a heroic party will keep on fighting, possibly to the bitter end. Because of that, Guild Wars are either extremely short or extremely destructive, and sometimes both. 

Like a normal war, a guild war is self-reinforcing. Once enough time has gone by, all the combatants will have much more concrete reasons to continue fighting than they had in the beginning. If a guild is responsible for the death of your fellow party member, it becomes an extremely personal fight.

Because each hero is invaluable to a guild during a time of war, assassination is a constant theme and a common tactic. Because of this, heroes can’t simply go on with their lives if their guild is fighting a guild war. It changes every aspect of their lives. They must either conduct operations or else be in hiding.



During a Guild War, members of participating guilds are generally considered to be exiled from the Great Guild, since they are openly violating [[The Principles]].

A Guild War typically involves large numbers of individuals exercising immense personal powers of varying descriptions, and in the process laying waste to farmland, [[Peasants]], mountains, wild animals, trees, soil, water, fish, and all forms of life and unlife.

Guild War differs radically from the forms of war that preceded it, during the [[Classical Era]].
