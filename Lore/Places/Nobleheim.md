#coastal #city #great-city-of-the-east 
The coastal city of Nobleheim is one of the great cities of the east. The walls of its buildings are made almost entirely of marble, supernaturally bleached a brilliant white. The city is said to wear three faces — for at three times a day the sun strikes the walls just so, causing light to spill over the courtyards, raised walkways, mansions, and palaces.

However, for all its beauty, the city is most known for the many cataclysms it has endured. These are officially recorded and known as Tragedies.

No one knows which Tragedy was the first, or even how many Tragedies the city has experienced. The official record, which names and dates six tragedies, only goes back fire hundred years or so, when the The Great Inferno incinerated all flammable material in the city.

However, thanks to the efforts of the [[Tragedians]] — an order of scholars dedicated to studying the subject, almost a millennium old — many others have been identified, though their date remains uncertain. Each Tragedy is ranked based on the degree of harm it caused the city.

# Tragedies
1. **Ritual of Sacrifice:** An abyssal rune was inscribed upon the city through carefully constructed walls and buildings. This brought about the mass sacrifice of most of the city's residents, leaving most architecture untouched.
   
2. **Siege of Shadow Beasts:** The city was besieged by an army of thousands of shadow beasts as part of a greater guild war..
3. **The Eclipse of Eternal Night**: Not eternal, but said to have lasted ten years. Caused the city to be pervaded by an intense cold. Most residents survived, however, by hiding in the vast undercity.
4. **The Cataclysm of Crystals**: Crystals bloomed out of the city's masonry structures. Caused severe damage to infrastructure that led to the deaths of thousands through starvation and injury.
5. **The Awakening of the Stone Guardians**: A small army of golems awakened within the bowls of the undercity and proceeded to ravage several quarters until eventually subdued by the city watch.
6. **The Great Inferno**: A ritual of unknown description or purpose caused the combustion of all flammable materials within the city, including paper, cloth, wood, and so on.
