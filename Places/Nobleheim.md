The coastal city of Nobleheim is one of the great cities of the east. The walls of its buildings are made almost entirely of marble, supernaturally bleached a brilliant white. The city is said to wear three faces — for at three times a day the sun strikes the walls just so, causing light to spill over the courtyards, raised walkways, mansions, and palaces.

However, for all its beauty, the city is most known for the many cataclysms it has endured. These are officially recorded and known as Tragedies.

No one knows which Tragedy was the first, or even how many Tragedies the city has experienced. The official record, which names and dates six tragedies, only goes back fire hundred years or so, when the The Great Inferno incinerated all flammable material in the city.

However, thanks to the efforts of the [[Tragedians]] — an order of scholars dedicated to studying the subject, almost a millennium old — many others have been identified, though their date remains uncertain. Each Tragedy is ranked based on the degree of harm it caused the city.
