> Every song sung in your name,
> heats the forge, kindles a flame;
> Every banner and every myth,
> they form the blade, they bind the sheath;
> The hilt is braided with your dearest scars
> joined by a pommel of fallen stars.

> Quench me in the blood of a dozen foes,
> atop an altar built of a hundred woes,
> engrave me with a thousand desperate cries,
> adorn me with a memory of distant skies.
