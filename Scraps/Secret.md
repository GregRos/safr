### The back door
Although songs might say otherwise, not all heroes are conscientious, very few are nice, and some don’t even care about the lives they are saving. 

In a more merciful world, maybe the guild would only accept into its ranks the worthiest and most honorable candidates. Perhaps you’d need proof of the purity of your soul or swear a mystical oath that makes you physically unable to take the life of another.

In this world, even in the heart of the guild lands, a 12-foot ogre can just stroll into a village and start eating people. To the guild, the calm that commoners see is an illusion. Death is around every corner. Heroes are extremely rare, there is never enough of them, and when you get hold of one – you simply do not let go.

While in that brighter world heroes might save people out of the goodness of their heart and the purity of their spirit, in this one heroes save people because it’s their job, they are very good at it, and people treat them like gods. It’s a much more reliable form of motivation.

Some stories talk of heroes being seduced by the wealth and power offered by the other side, but there aren’t many entities in the multiverse capable of offering a better deal than the guild. Which is why things usually go the other way.

The guild, after all, understands that people make mistakes. You make one bad choice, then another, and suddenly you find yourself kidnapping victims to sacrifice in a profane ritual to gain immortal life.

The guild doesn’t have a problem with immortal life per se. In fact, some of its leading members are themselves immortal. However, it does feel that some methods of achieving the end result aren’t compatible with its philosophies. But not all is lost! A guild-sanctioned group of researchers is currently conducting an investigation into the subject, and they would appreciate an expert in certain exotic forms of magic. 

This does come with all the standard benefits of membership, but there is the small matter. A simple gesture made in good faith. *Your master’s phylactery. You will give it to us.*

The back door is largely unknown. Those who enter it discard their old identities. They must adopt a new face and wear a new body. They must never speak of its existence. It will only be offered once, at the discretion of certain guild officials and under conditions that are never spoken aloud. Lastly, it will never be offered to a traitor.
