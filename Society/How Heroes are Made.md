Anyone can be a hero. It’s not about gender, background, or even skill. There is a test for it, and it’s actually very, very simple. All you need to do is to prevail against seemingly impossible odds.

### The Ogre Test
For instance, let’s say that an ogre has invaded your village. The creature is 12 feet tall, and it’s using a small tree as a club. You, as a nineteen year old girl, decide that the best course of action is to grab the stick sword you played with as a child, brandish it high above your head, and charge. 

At this point, there are two ways things can go. In nine out of ten universes, the ogre kills you. Then it eats you.

But in that tenth universe, a party of heroes arrives at the village to find you calmly perched atop the ogre’s remains. “Took you long enough,“ you might mutter. “Been waiting here for an hour.“

How did you beat the ogre? Maybe you were guided by the spirits of the earth. Or maybe you suddenly discovered a talent for elven sword magic. Or maybe you just got really really angry.

Any and all of these could and have been true, and it doesn’t even matter. At this point, your life – which had previously consisted of milking cows and not wanting to marry someone – has changed forever. You will live in riches, die gloriously, and might even get to save the world a few times.

### The side entrance
To the mind of a guild master, the primary requirement for a prospective is *usefulness.* But you don’t need to be  able to take down an ogre with a stick to be useful to a party of heroes. There are all kinds of side entrances – other tests one can pass to earn the guild’s notice.

For instance, a guild might have a vault somewhere on its premises where powerful relics are kept. While the primary purpose of these vaults is to keep safe the relics, they also serve as an entrance exam for prospective candidates. The guild does, after all, have a soft spot for thieves and rogues of all colors.

While that might sound easier, in truth this option is no less dangerous than the Ogre Test. The guild has a soft spot for *successful* thieves. Failed ones are of no interest to it. That’s why every pickpocket isn’t granted immediate membership and why those vaults can stay unopened for decades.

Once again, this is a test you can take only once. Although not universally fatal, few thieves can ply their trade without limbs.
