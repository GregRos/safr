Even most powerful mages need to eat, and for all its great utility, arcane magic fails to provide a good replacement for the fruits of the earth, delivered through common labor.

The divine gift is somewhat more effective. However, though the results tend to be edible more often than not, the gods transcend the earthly considerations of flavor, no doubt prioritizing spiritual essence. This makes divinely conjured bread an excellent choice as a starvation food, one commonly enjoyed during protracted sieges.

This all means that the mightiest of heroes still ultimately rely on the common peasant. Crops must be planted in the soil, which must then be harvested. Some of it is fed to beasts of various colors, shapes, and sizes. Some of those beasts are slaughtered, while others are kept for their products – milk, wool, and so forth.

This forms an immense human chain of common folk simply doing their jobs. Commoners often have little knowledge or understanding of what lies beyond a small cluster of settlements. What information they possess is delivered through retellings of myths and legends by the [[Storytellers]], and these are often meant to entertain rather than teach.

# Taxes
Commoners generally do not own the land upon which they toil – in fact, land ownership is not a concept that applies in rural areas.

Instead, the land upon which peasants toil is *protected* by the Guild and *managed* by the [[Nobles]]. The nobles levee a tax on the peasants, which consists of some portion of the crops they grow or the animals they husband. 

Although some of the produce ultimately fills Guild stockpiles, the Guild itself never takes anything from the peasants, as that would break the cycle on which society is built.

In fact, the Guild is always willing to protect the peasantry from the predation of the nobility, often leading uprisings when the latter attempts to unjustly extort the former. These date to ancient times, when the nobility could even force the peasants to fight their destructive and pointless wars.

# Movement
The nobility imposes edicts which control the movement of peasants from place to place, for their own safety. These edicts are often enforced by the Guild, and only those with Guild escorts or the right papers can travel freely.

This doesn’t concern most peasants much. In fact, many aren’t even aware of it, as travel between settlements is extremely dangerous in any case.

The settlements themselves are protected by the Guild with methods ranging from runes of magical power to hordes of undead, depending on the specific guild in question. Even these protections sometimes fail due to mysterious reasons, however, so you can imagine what might happen to a poor peasant caught on the road. 

# Relations to Groups

## Heroes
When it comes to heroes, peasants often treat the legend as the thing itself. To them, every single hero is a paragon of virtue, and the only valid reaction to their presence is reverential awe. Only the vilest of their number would offer the smallest degree of disrespect. 

Similarly, they tend to be blind to the arrogance and selfishness of heroes. Because of this, it’s generally seen as bad form for a hero to prey on them. It helps that peasants have literally nothing a hero would ever want.

## Nobles
Peasants mock and despise the nobility, viewing any action taken by a noble with a degree of distrust. This isn’t helped by tax the nobility levee on the peasants or the relative luxury in which they live.
