In a dangerous world, heroes are necessary for social and economic stability. They Get Things Done™. As individual parties of heroes form, break apart, travel to various places, they find themselves with friends everywhere. These friends organize into societies that share information and resources, as well as providing much needed staging grounds in far-flung lands.

This is the beginning of the Hero’s Guild, the greatest heroic organization this world has ever known. A safe haven for those who are brave enough to risk their lives for society as a whole (and also fame and glory and lots and lots of money.)

While the heroes do agree on the formation of a guild, they can’t agree on anything else. Not the banner of said guild, nor the color, or a lot of other things besides. This turns this one big theoretical guild into a network of individual guilds that try to maintain good relations with each other.

Anyway, let’s fast forward a couple of thousand years. The hero’s guild has, in many parts of the world, become omnipresent. Each individual guild hall, with its own iconography, is the center of its own little ideological fiefdom. The guilds don’t really rule, not directly, but rulers that don’t have the support of at least one don’t seem to last for very long.

That area over which the guilds have almost full control over is called the guild lands. It’s a vast territory divided into different geographic regions (which we won’t talk about right now). It has borders, but they lie in far-flung and exotic lands that we won’t go to.

Other points of interest, though, are the legendary cities that are too big and powerful even for the guild to swallow whole. Some can be found on the coasts, but others exist as enclaves within the guild lands. In any case, their names are immortalized in songs older than the guild itself.

These are places where even the guild treads lightly, but in most cases they are still local powers, unable to challenge the guild’s authority anywhere except within their borders. 

There is also the geography of the guild lands, inter-guild relations, the bureaucracy of the guild, and so on. Let’s not go there right now.

# The names and colors
Every guild has, at minimum, one name and one banner. However, others have entire sets of iconography — a banner, an emblem, a flag, and so forth — while others have a few abstract lines on a blank canvas.

Their names also vary in length. Some can be as long as a full sentence, similar to a passage from a story, while others are short and descriptive. 

Here are the names and banners of two guilds.
