This is the site for the SAFR setting. I’m keeping the abbreviation. I’ve always wanted to backronym something.

This page will introduce the different services we use to run the campaign. We’re at **the world encyclopædia**. 

# [World Encyclopædia](https://publish.obsidian.md/safr/World)
This is where stuff about the setting will go. Your characters might not know a lot of the stuff in here, especially the [[Sinister Truths]]. 

In fact, there might be things that your character won’t want to know. They have their own motivations, which might not hinge upon the life of the average peasant.

# [Virtual Tabletop](https://safr.gregros.dev/game)
This is where we play SAFR when a map and tokens are needed. It has your sheets, my sheets, all the sheets.

Right now we’re using **Foundry VTT**. However we might switch to something else if it’s not a good fit or is annoying.

I really don’t like roll20 for various reasons, but there are other options.

## The journal
FoundryVTT has a journal. This journal will only contain in-game stuff.

# Discord
This is where we hang.
