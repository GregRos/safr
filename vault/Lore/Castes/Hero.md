Heroes are those individuals blessed with providence â€“ an almost mystical ability to survive 
However, 

Some heroes are powerful spellcasters who learned the craft from their masters, but many heroes instead gain strange and unusual powers that seem to defy the standard laws of magsic.

I mean, an article abou whatt heroes ARE. and it starts with:

Heroes are people who have providence on their side. To the standard mortal, storming a cave full of goblins waiting in ambush is tantamount to suicide. After all, although each individual goblin is a terrible shot, at least a few are likely to hit the mark due to random chance if nothing else.

  
Points:

* The world seems to bend in favor of the hero.
* Heroes can come out of deadly battles with barely a scratch.
* Even badly wounded, heroes fight with the same tenacity as when they were at full health.
* Many heroes find themselves with strange mystical powers that are unusual, exotic, prodigious. 
* The tragic pasts of many heroes indicates they survived something that many others did not.
* In fact, the core of a heroâ€™s talents is always survivability. Whether wielding a sword, hanging off a cliff, or other stuff â€” they will survive.
* People are usually not born with the gift of providence. Instead, they gain it at some pivotal, usually dangerous moment in their lives.
* Because heroism only appears after these events, there is no way to teach heroism. Itâ€™s not a skill.
* And people have tried tons of ways to teach heroism, none of them worked.
* Teaching heroes is possible, but they differ so much in their skills and talents that itâ€™s not practical.
* Heroes are extremely privileged in every walk of life. Concerns like getting food to eat are usually not as important to them. This makes them more likely to do nice things when compared to commoners desperately trying to survive.
* However, most heroes arenâ€™t â€œnice.â€œ and some might be downright evil.


Some more points:
* The effect of a hero on the world can have consequences, as by being protected themselves, heroes can end up causing the deaths of others. This happens a lot in guild wars.
