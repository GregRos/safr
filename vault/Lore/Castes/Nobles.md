During the [[Classical Era]] being a noble meant having power that you could use as you saw fit. In those days, the only reliable way to defend your kingdom from monsters was to take a few young men who don’t know any better, give them weapons they could barely use, and gesture vaguely at the uncaring wilderness. 

As society changedand heroes grew in prominence, the nobility lost its power and most of their privileges. They might still administer the lands that had been in their family for thousands of years, but they only do so at the behest of the guilds.

# Titled Bureaucrats
![[CycleSociety.png|right|300]]Nobles are essentially the heads of bureaucracies that consist of small armies of officials, some of whom may be their family members. These form the noble household which manages some of guild’s land on its behalf.

And yet they still play the part of a noble of old, complete with all the trappings. They have servants, opulent mansions, titles, and perhaps even a handful of guards. Family members vie with each other for prestige, seeking the guild’s favor, and may yearn to overthrow the current head of their house. 

As part of their job, nobles levee obligations on commoners and merchants. These obligations consist of paying taxes, obeying laws, reporting agricultural yields, and so forth. They also hear the petitions of the common folk, handle small matters of justice, arrest common lawbreakers, and report any seditious activity to the guild.

This creates a social cycle in which heroes are seen as guardians and protectors, while nobles are seen as greedy overlords who merely take from their subjects. The occasional noble rebellion against guild authority helps cement this pantomime and helps the guild maintain the facade.

This is helpful, at it means that the commoners’ ire will never be directed towards the guild, but rather towards the nobility. In fact, commoners will sometimes seek the guild’s aid due to the unfair taxes leveed by their noble when those taxes were actually a result of the guild increasing its demands.
