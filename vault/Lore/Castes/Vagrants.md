In principle, any travel between settlements requires a guild escort – for the traveler’s own safety. In practice, however, guild rates are quite high and there are rarely enough guild members who are bored enough to actually take escort jobs.

This means that in practice, people do travel the roads, usually in small bands. These could be a group of peasants travelling to the next village, small merchant caravans selling various wares, and so on. Everyone knows it’s technically a crime, but it’s in the best interest of everyone to ignore that.

However, this gives rise to **vagrants.** These are people who do not belong, are not where they’re supposed to be, and move from settlement to settlement. They typically carry weapons – which while not illegal is certainly suspicious – and take odd jobs, whether as day laborers or sell swords.
