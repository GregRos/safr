While the guild is always hiring and the deal it offers is second to none, no safe path leads to its doors. Most who try for membership do not succeed, and very few are brave enough to even take the test.

Most people are happy to see themselves as commoners, nobles, craftsmen, and so forth – and go on with their lives. However, there are many that don’t. These people are the mercenaries, charlatans, pickpockets, *knights of the dirt*. Pretenders.

They are pitied, mocked, or simply ignored. You can recognize them by their ragged clothes, unwashed appearance (but not heroically unwashed like a real barbarian), dejected countenance, and the scent of desperation. They chase after glory, sure that one day they will get their big break, but unlike actual heroes tend to lag a step behind.

Some of them literally pretend to be heroes, usually members of a far-flung guild, but not as many as you might think. There are two reasons for this.

1. In a world where heroes enjoy unrestricted privilege above others, spotting fakes is something every child learns during adolescence. There are all sorts of signs – ranging from the number of scars to the style of dress to a particular gait.
2. Those who are actually good enough to fool guild members will simply be recruited.
