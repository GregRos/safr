All individual guilds collectively form a vast network that stretches across almost the entirety of the known world. This network is known as the [[Great Guild]]. 

The Great Guild is a conceptual framework rather than an organized group. It has no territories, no leader, and no list of members. However, it’s a powerful symbol for the unity of the guilds, and it helps maintain peace between guilds that can differ greatly in their ideologies.

The different guilds are united by [[The Principles]], a set of rules that govern the interactions between guilds, which it’s in the best interest of everyone to uphold.
