In a world long removed from the era of nations and kingdoms, guilds have become the dominant force in society and politics. These guilds, evolving beyond traditional professional associations, replaced ancient governmental structures long ago. This shift has profoundly reshaped societal dynamics, establishing guilds as the primary form of governance.

Guilds, initially formed as networks of [[Heroes]], have evolved from informal alliances into powerful, sovereign entities. Originating from heroes' needs for collaboration and support, these guilds have grown into influential collectives, commanding extensive territories.

Guilds, varying significantly in size, ideology, and structure, range from small bands to massive organizations with thousands of members. Regardless of their size, each guild is defined by its heroic members, who are essential for enforcing the guild's will, serving effectively as its army and militia.

Being sovereign powers, guilds are bound not by laws, but by alliances, obligations, and the politics of power. They coexist peacefully only through adherence to [[The Principles]], which provide a basic framework that governs guild and hero relations.

A guild’s sovereignty rests on its ability to defend its interests and territories, and thus on its capacity to wage [[Guild War]]. While guild war is no longer common, the ability to wage it is a primary concern for every guild.

# Guild Lands
The guilds together divide most of the known world into *guild lands*, territories under their protection. Since they have a monopoly on protection in these lands, they also have a monopoly on force, meaning they can do in these lands as they see fit.

Guilds seldom manage their territories directly, delegating day-to-day governance to [[nobles]] and local leaders. These traditional leaders operate under the guilds' overarching influence, fully aware of their subordinate role.

Guild lands usually consist of multiple settlements, such as villages, towns, cities, and so forth. These settlements have their own law enforcement groups, like a city watch. However, the purpose of these groups is to discourage and punish lawbreaking by commoners. They will report any serious incidents, such as monster attacks, to the guild.

Guilds don’t rely on these groups for information, and will frequently maintain their own networks of informants within the community. These are usually ordinary people, such as bakers, farmers, artisans, or merchants. They also act as part-time spies for the guild, reporting on events that might destabilize the region, and serve as an additional check on the nobility.
