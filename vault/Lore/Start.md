> Right now the encyclopedia is meant to give you a broad understanding of how society functions. 

It doesn’t have any specifics – I’ll fill those in as you discover them (or make them up.)

The result is similar to the generic fantasy setting, which lets you build a character without worrying too much about this stuff. However, the social structure is nothing like medieval Europe.

> [[Hero|Heroes]] run the world, and [[nobles]] are just fancy bureaucrats.

The most important organization is the [[Guild|heroic guild]]. These guilds cover the known world and act as sovereign, territorial entities – kind of like nation-states. Together they form a network called the [[Great Guild]].
