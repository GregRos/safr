Guilds have long delved into ancient temples, ransacked altars, and raided tombs, with a significant portion of their yearly treasure hauls originating from abandoned places of 
worship. 

This exploration has led them to a profound understanding: throughout history, as long as mortals have existed, they have worshipped gods, but the nature and identity of these gods have continually evolved and changed. 

Even during the present day, the number and variety of gods and pantheons worshipped throughout the [[Great Guild]] is staggering.

This conucopia has been commented on for thousands of years, resulting in both treatises on the nature of the di vine and works of art. A common theme has been the concept of an *Ocean of Gods*, in which the gods are compared to an infinite ocean.

# Powerful
Despite the ever-changing nature of gods, the power stemming from divinity remains undeniable. Throughout history, gods have influenced the world, albeit indirectly, through the actions and faith of their followers. 

# Unknowable
The gods do not perform miracles; they either respond precisely to prayers as asked or remain silent. They neither preach nor make demands, though their followers might do so on their behalf.

There are believers who claim to hear the gods speaking directly to them, but such experiences are deeply personal and only affect the most ardent followers. Intriguingly, the messages purportedly received from the gods can vary greatly, sometimes even contradicting what others believe they have heard.

Are there many gods, or only one? Can they interact with each other or the world itself? Where does divine power originate?

Many believe these questions are literally unanswerable, while others have their answer – the power of their god, through its ardent believers, is enough proof for that god’s existence.
