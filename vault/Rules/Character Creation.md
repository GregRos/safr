# Basics

### Starting Level
3rd, but expected to level up quickly.

### Ability Scores
32 point buy, maximums still enforced.

### Equipment
Starting equipment.

### Race
Nothing with a fly speed.

### Character Themes
Characters should adhere to western fantasy tropes.

# Background
You start as [[Vagrants]] who want to get to [[Nobleheim]] for whatever reason. You don’t know each other.

That place has tons of cool stuff in it, there is probably something there you want. Feel free to invent your own cool stuff.

However, you’re also 3rd level. This means that while you’re not part of a [[guild]], you *could* be part of one. You’ve just had your reasons to fly under the radar.

# Variants
This is for official variants and options in the **core books**.

### Feats and Multiclassing
Yes.

### Race/Class Variants
Also yes, just say which options or variants you're using.

### Others
No other variants, so no inspiration for example. We'll probably add stuff like that in the future. I have all sorts of ideas.

# Homebrew
**Case-by-case basis**, and **subject to balancing mid-game if it causes issues**, but generally go for it.

Homebrew resources will be added to the Homebrew section of the Journal, along with any usages and notes.
