This is mainly putting down the things we talked about in writing.

## Starting Level
3rd, but expected to level up quickly.

## Ability Scores
32 point buy, maximums still enforced.

## Equipment
Assume starting equipment for now, but it might change when I figure out how to best bend the DMG guidelines.

## Race
Nothing with a fly speed, and nothing completely outlandish.

## Character Themes
Characters should adhere to western fantasy tropes. Additional elements:

- Magitech
- Gunpowder

## Homebrew
**Case-by-case basis**, and **subject to balancing mid-game if it causes issues**, but generally go for it.

Homebrew resources will be added to the Homebrew section of the Journal, along with any usages and notes.
