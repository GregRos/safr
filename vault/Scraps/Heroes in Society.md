A hero is, in many practical respects, above the law. The law, after all, is just there to make sure commoners behave themselves. The nobles definitely aren’t subject to it, and everyone knows they do what the guild tells them to do.

A lot of the things that might seem like crimes are, if done by a hero, more akin to harmless pranks.

Take theft, for example. With a sufficiently glorious past, you can just walk into the treasury of the Duke of Someplace, take his Priceless Artifact, and walk out. If you manage to pull this off without seriously hurting anyone, the best most dukes can do is beg you to have it back. 

There is no army of guards that can be sent after you – regular guards will run away before trying to confront a hero. From the duke’s perspective, getting the guild to do anything about it is a bureaucratic nightmare that has a chance to end in a guild war or just get him replaced.

Now, your actions might well have *consequences,* possibly bad ones, but they’ll always be the result of power politics instead of the rule of law. For instance:

* The duke is also hero, something which is not uncommon. Generally, these will be old heroes who have retired. Those guys are terrifying on every level. You do not want to mess with them.
* Either you seriously harm someone during the prank, or else the duke can make it look like you did. In this case, you can be declared a **menace**, basically a hero who’s gone to the bad. The guild has a very different system for dealing with those, and it begins by treating you like a rampaging monster. This is generally seen as a death sentence.
* Though it’s very unlikely, you could end up sparking a small, local Guild War. In this case, anything could happen, including your guild being destroyed. Neither you nor the duke will survive unscathed, and there is a good chance you’ll have to exile yourself to lands unknown because everyone will know you’re more trouble than you’re worth.

The amount to which you can twist the world around you is directly proportional to the glory you accumulate.

Take the extreme case, a storied paladin who has saved the world numerous times. She is not merely above the law — her word trumps any law.

She could, in principle, just declare that the duke is an evil werewolf or something, whereupon said duke will be hanged immediately, possibly by his own family members together with an angry populous. At the same time, such an action could have similarly ridiculous consequences, up to and including a holy war gripping the entirety of the guild lands.

No one does any of this stuff, though. Guild wars are rare, and are usually local in scale. Holy wars don’t spring up randomly. Heroes seem to toe the line, even if some run very close. This isn’t a coincidence.
