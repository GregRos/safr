Uhh the lore thing got out of hand. Not sure why I thought it would go different from the last setting I tried writing.

## How to be a hero



Few are good enough to fool another guild member, and there are all kinds of punishments that are meted out to the failures. Those that succeed rarely keep up the pretense for very long – they’ll just be recruited. 







These are the people one hires when real heroes simply cost too much. They are also hired for tasks heroes simply will never do. 







Being a hero always means being a member of a guild. The ability to swing a sword or even cast a spell isn’t enough. The Ogre Test is, on one hand, simple – but on the other, merciless. It also relies on a degree of providence. While to the guild they are far too common a threat, most people never meet an ogre in their lives. 

The other options can be just as dangerous. You could try to steal a relic from the guild vaults, but that’s just as lethal an option. While they can serve 





### The pretenders and the rising stars
The guild’s philosophy of placing ability above ideology has a converse — 

Now, your identity as Lady Sable, the Grave Whisperer will need to go. 



Heroes may not see non-heroes as people. They might completely ignore them or take advantage of them. There are limits, of course. There is a line that heroes must not cross, and though it’s 


While some might balk at the idea, anyone who has held significant power understands that there is a calculus to human lives.



Not all heroes can actually kill an ogre with a stick, though. Not all heroes are about killing anything. 

There’s going to be an interview process and you might have to fill out some forms, but you’re in. Just like that.



Obviously, people are going to ask how you killed the ogre. But don’t expect surprise. 

In ninety out of a hundred universes, the ogre kills you. Then it eats you. In the rest, a party of heroes arrive at the village to find you calmly sitting atop

For instance, let’s say that an ogre has invaded your village. The creature is 12 feet tall, and it’s using a small tree as a club. You, as a nineteen year old girl, decide that the best course of action is to grab the stick sword you had played with as a child, raise it high above your head, and charge. 

At this point, there are two ways things can go. In nine out of ten universes, the ogre kills you. Then it eats you.

For instance, imagine that a minotaur or some other massive creature from who knows where has started preying on 

However, there is no hero academy. There is no school of heroics. It’s a trade no one can teach and that, some say, is impossible to learn. And yet some people are very, very good at it. Quite a big problem is that the only way of telling

Being a hero means belonging to the elite. It means 
Being a hero means, almost universally, belonging to a guild. While you could save a village from a rampaging monster, people might call you brave, foolhardy, or skilled – but they wouldn’t call you a hero.

Many, however, do try to accomplish these things. Being a hero means being a member of the ruling elite. If you dream of greatness, there is no 

You might aspire to guild membership, you might curse the guild because it has power and you don’t, or you might work against the guild to further your own plans.

There are also some few organizations – whether religious, ideological, or professional – that the guild does have to treat with respect and on some sort of equal footing. A circle of powerful mages bound by arcane oaths, a great church with its own military order, or a merchant cabal that controls massive amounts of wealth.

### The pretenders
Even these people understand that they are an island in a calm blue ocean that is far, far greater than them. They have their local dominion, but their influence is limited. 



## How to become a hero
Anyone can become a hero, in principle, and everyone wants to become one in fact. Knowing that, you might wonder why the world isn’t full of them. Well, it certainly has a lot, but never enough that some can be turned away.

The reasons are quite simple, really. There are three of them.

1. There is no school for adventuring. There is only one path

**There is no school for adventuring. There is no way to train heroes**



So, given the many perks of being a hero – namely, being untouchable – you might wonder why the world isn’t full of heroes. It certainly has a lot of them, but never enough that more aren’t welcomed with open arms.













Now, this isn’t written anywhere. It’s just a consequence of how the world works. Within the Guild Lands, heroes are either part of the ruling Guild or a member of an allied guild. 



3. Have their own very similar group
4. Have autocracies strong enough to outlaw it
5. Are just that special

That’s not to say that being free of the guild is a good thing. 



heroes are Good, nominally, but that also means they believe they know better than anyone else. 

You live in lands such as these, called the Guild Lands by some. A vast grassy plane which allows for fast transportation. Lands are ruled by detached fiefdoms, dukedoms, and baronies – without any larger kingdoms or nations. Rulers not blessed by the hero’s guild don’t seem to last for very long.







That definitely counts as a level of irony I think, whether you’re the real chosen one or not.

This isn’t the lore dump BTW, that’s taking more time than I thought. Just an update

Also, some guy can come from a faraway land where they believe in some other random stuff and have never heard of the gods that people in this area believe in.
