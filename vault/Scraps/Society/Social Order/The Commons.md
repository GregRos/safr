How is the world like for commoners?

They’ve heard of great empires and vast kingdoms from passing travelers, but such things are foreign to them. They know the world as a patchwork quilt of fiefdoms, dukedoms, and baronies. In these lands, there is no need for armies. There are no conscripts or knights. The borders don’t matter because they only shift when the guilds want them to. Nobles play at lordship while real matters are decided between men and women who can crush rocks with their minds.

The guilds are always there. Not in a bad way, but like a comforting blanket that just stretches on and on forever without end. They have different banners and they sometimes go to war. But in another way they’re also all the same, copies of each other with the names changed and moral compasses shifted.

While commoners understand the guild lands aren’t actually infinite, they might as well be.

And that’s a good thing. The wild is dangerous, with terrifying creatures lurking behind every corner. Only the guild lands are relatively safe, and even they suffer from monster incursions – and worse. It doesn’t help that many heroes who actually want to make a name for themselves often head to more distant parts, since glory is one of those things that looks bigger from further away.
