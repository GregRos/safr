This page will introduce the different services we use to run the campaign. We’re at **the world encyclopædia**. 

# [World Encyclopædia](https://world.safr.gregros.dev/Lore/Start)
This is where stuff about the setting will go. A lot of it is stuff your characters might not know personally.

# [Virtual Tabletop](https://safr.gregros.dev/game)
This is where we play SAFR when a map and tokens are needed. It has your sheets, my sheets, all the sheets.

Right now we’re using **Foundry VTT**. However we might switch to something else if it’s not a good fit or is annoying.

I really don’t like roll20 for various reasons, but there are other options.

## Journal
FoundryVTT has a journal. This journal will only contain in-game stuff.

# Discord
This is where we hang.
